electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",WalmartCustomer,5,"We are an Apple family (iPhones, iPads, MacBooks). My daughter is leaving for college next month, so she won't be able to borrow my wife's MacBook for her schoolwork. I was excited to see Walmart become the distributor for the **** M1 MacBook Air. Apple has moved on to focus on their M2 and M3 chip offerings, but the M1 is still a great machine, especially for a college student. It was already a great price at $****, but with it on sale for $****, it was too good to pass up! I was grateful I could afford it. Thanks again!"
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",emma,5,Came in brand new fancy packaging!  I have been wanting one of these forever but couldn't justify the price . I got the silver so it matched my Chromebook when I work side by side. Operating system takes getting used to if you use. Chromebooks but it's easy enough. (CTRL   F is command F and so on...)
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Scott,5,"Was worried from seeing reviews by others that Walmart was shipping out refurbished units. Wasn't the case for me. Not crazy about the specs, but for $650 I'm willing to compromise."
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",WalmartCustomer,5,"The product ordering and the item itself is fine. OnTrac shipping asked for a signature... I also provided written instructions to place the item behind a corner by our front door. Instead, the driver just left it, on the ground, directly in front of the front door, easily visible from the street. Drivers are busy people... but if they aren't reading specific instructions, what is Walmart's liability for package loss?"
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Queen,5,I've always wanted a MacBook and I saw that this one was on sale so I couldn't resist. It was delivered the next day. It came brand new in all of its Apple packaging and it was double boxed so it was extra protected during shipping. It was super easy and quick to set up. I'm so happy with my purchase and I'm glad I treated myself.
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Teresa,1,Shipping delayed by days. Package delivery “signed” by delivery driver. I have cameras. Driver didn't even knock on door. Buy from Apple!!! Was told package had to be signed for so took vacation day off work. I could have paid a little more directly at the Apple Store for a newer model after taking into account delayed shipping and days of work.  Lesson learned!!
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Adrian,1,"NOT NEW! This is my second attempt on receiving a new MacBook Air this time I received it in basic Walmart bag no plastic seal around package so I opened it while the driver was there looked inside the laptop didn't have it out. The bottom was all scratched up they definitely did a deal with Apple and are selling all of their returned damaged MacBooks. And for the Walmart rep, when you read this, I will delete this review when you make it right"

electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Ronisha,1,Fedex delivered my package to the wrong door I opened a case with them called Walmart their supervisor hung up in my face and stated he had my signature in front of his face and was rude and disgusting. This is the image fedex provided NOT MY SIGNATURE and I provided my RING CAM FOOTAGE. Never ordering electronics online from here again. Disputing with my bank as well as filing a police report and formal complaint with Walmart Delivery for how I was treated even as an employee.
electronics,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3 inch Laptop - Space Gray, M1 Chip, Built for Apple Intelligence, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage",Chery,1,I ordered because Walmart promised delivery on Saturday. Waited all day because learned AFTER ordering that a signature would be required. No email or text that delivery of desperately-needed replacement computer would not arrive for two more days. Wasted day. BAD SERVICE WALMART….disclose signature required and have ACCURATE delivery info.

furniture,"Renwick Faux Leather Barrel Accent Chair for Living Room, Set of 2, Black",WalmartCustomer,5,It is a very nice little chair. Espresso leather color accurate to website and matches my other chairs well.  Sizing just as advertised. It's comfy to sit in for extra seating in my LR for guests. The back is short so not a tall people chair but perfect for what I needed as an accent chair and extra seating.

furniture,"Renwick Faux Leather Barrel Accent Chair for Living Room, Set of 2, Black",Murph,2,"Very nice looking piece, but very uncomfortable.

furniture,"Renwick Faux Leather Barrel Accent Chair for Living Room, Set of 2, Black",Gail,2,"The chairs are very uncomfortable. After I put the legs on the chairs, I had to do a lot of adjustment to keep them from wobbling one side to the other. I plan on returning them."
furniture,"Renwick Faux Leather Barrel Accent Chair for Living Room, Set of 2, Black",Erin,2,"These chairs are tiny. The back of the chair ends at my lower back so basically, no back support at all.
